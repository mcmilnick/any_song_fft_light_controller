# any_song_light_controller
Send any song to a Pi, analyze the frequency spectrum, and control light strips.

This project goes with a walkthrough on my website...
https://techtures.wordpress.com/nicks-projects/any-song-christmas-lights/

By the end, you connect to your Pi via bluetooth, send any song, analyze the frenquency spectrum
of the song, and control strands of lights based of it.
